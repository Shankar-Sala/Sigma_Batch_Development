//Truthy and falsy

// Everything in js is true or false (in boolean context). 

// This doesn't mean their value itself is false or true, but they are treated as true and false if taken in boolean context.

if (false) {
    console.log("It has true value");
} else {
    console.log("It has false value");
}
